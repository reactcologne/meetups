Dear fellow React-enthusiasts!

We are looking forward to seeing you this DATE at X! We are happy that so many people are interested and we have enough space that everyone currently on the list can join. Nevertheless, please update your RSVP if you cannot attend the event.

There will be pizza and drinks. You can find the location details in the meetup description.

Also, we would like to point out, that there is a website for the React Cologne Group: https://react.cologne/. There, you can also find our Slack channel which you are more than welcome to join.

Last but not least, we would like to inform you, that a React Barcamp Weekend is happening again in 2020. The date is not finalized yet (probably February/March). Just keep an eye on https://twitter.com/ReactBarcamp for the date announcement.

Looking forward to seeing you on Thursday!
