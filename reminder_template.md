TItle: React Cologne Meetup this WEEKDAY

Dear fellow React-enthusiasts!

We are looking forward to seeing you this WEEKDAY, MONTH XX at XX.XX! We are happy that so many people are interested and we have just enough space that everyone currently on the list can join. Please update your RSVP if you cannot attend the event so that new people can join us.

Location & Food: There will be pizza and drinks üçïü•≥ and you can find the location details in the meetup description.

Almost as important as pizza: the website for the React Cologne Group https://react.cologne/. There, you can also find our Slack channel which you are more than welcome to join. 

Last but not least: a React Barcamp Weekend is happening again in 2020!
The date is not finalized yet (probably February/March). Just keep an eye on https://twitter.com/ReactBarcamp for the date announcement.

Looking forward to seeing you on WEEKDAY!
